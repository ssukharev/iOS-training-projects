# Make your contribution!

Any help is welcome and highly appreciated! If you want to contribute to the repository, the following instructions will help you get started...

## Development
### Necessary tools
- [XCode 16 version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
or 
- any other editor that supports iOS app development
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting to work

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository is on your GitHub account and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) install it on your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iOS-training-projects.git
    cd iOS-training-projects/
    ```
    
2. Add the remote `upstream`:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ssukharev/iOS-training-projects
    ```
    
    ---
   
    OR
    

    ### Working with a single subfolder ([sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout))

    If you donâ€™t want to keep the entire repository locally and plan to work only inside your own project folder, use Git sparse-checkout. With this approach, your local copy will contain only the specified subfolder, while commits and pushes will still go to the shared repository.
   
   #### Prerequisites:

   1. Clone without checking out files:
   ```bash
   git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iOS-training-projects.git
    cd iOS-training-projects
   ```
   2. Enable sparse-checkout:
    ```bash
    git sparse-checkout init --cone
    ```
    3. Select only your project folder:
    ```bash
    git sparse-checkout set NEW_APP
    ```
    4. Create a feature branch.
       
    5. Work as usual inside NEW_APP and commit only that path:
   ```bash
   git add NEW_APP
   git commit -m "feat(NEW_APP): initial structure"
   git push -u origin feature/NEW_APP
   ```
    6. Keep your branch up to date with the latest main (rebase-only policy):
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push -f
   ```
    ---

4. Switch to the Develop branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    ```
    or
   create new branch with your name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME main
   ```

5. Add completed work or other changes

    - Be sure to follow the [design guidelines](#contributing-code).
    - If you need to update your fork, you can do so by doing a `rebase` with `upstream`:
      ```bash
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/main
      git push origin BRANCH_NAME -f
      ```
   
### <a name="contributing-code"></a>Design recommendations
- All commits **must** follow the [naming convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Pull requests with commits that do not comply with this standard **will not** be accepted.
- Please make meaningful commit names or combine them (using `squash`) before opening the pool request.
  - Do not merge commits after someone has started checking your changes.
- Always use `rebase` for your commits to the current `main` branch. **Do not** use `merge main` in your branch.
- You are responsible for keeping your branch up to date. Your work **will not** be accepted unless it is migrated from the latest `main` branch.
- You can create a "draft" of the pull request in advance to get feedback on your work.
- Do not overload your work with unnecessary files that do not affect the understanding and performance of the completed task.
- To add comments to your work that you consider **important** for its completion, use README.md the files are in the root of their folder.
